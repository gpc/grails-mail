The Grails mail plugin provides a convenient DSL for _sending_ email. It supports plain text, html, attachments, inline resources and i18n among other features.

Mail can be sent using the @mailService@ via the @sendMail@ method. Here is an exampleâ€¦

{code}
mailService.sendMail {
   to "fred@gmail.com","ginger@gmail.com"
   from "john@gmail.com"
   cc "marge@gmail.com", "ed@gmail.com"
   bcc "joe@gmail.com"
   subject "Hello John"
   text 'this is some text'
}
{code}

Here we are sending a plain text email with no attachments to the given addresses.
