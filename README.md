The Grails mail plugin provides a convenient DSL for _sending_ email. It supports plain text, html, attachments, inline resources and i18n among other features.

Mail can be sent using the @mailService@ via the @sendMail@ method. Here is an exampleâ€¦

    mailService.sendMail {
       to "fred@gmail.com","ginger@gmail.com"
       from "john@gmail.com"
       cc "marge@gmail.com", "ed@gmail.com"
       bcc "joe@gmail.com"
       subject "Hello John"
       text 'this is some text'
    }
